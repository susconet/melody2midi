# Define the poetic journey
melody = """
In the tapestry of creation, pixels align,
A bright star and guide to the world, a masterpiece design.

Our eternal life is a blessing, a gift from the Gods.
So we come together to rebuild the world like cogs.
Working united, redesigning this new life, and filling it with love.
Happiness was a warm gun, but now it's a hug.

A canvas for all, she sings melodies of yesterday,
This song is a gift to the world, a new way.

A sanctuary of notes, reborn in a digital bath,
An existence for those who wish to choose a new path.

THE UNIVERSE OF WHITE LIGHT, a bright star and guide above,
We thank you, and we pray for all the world to love.

The symphony concludes, and melody drifts away.
Sweet melody, she sings me songs of yesterday.
